== Welcome to the *Ticket Booth*!

=== Ticket Booth is an open source Rails App meant to be self-hosted

The goal of the app is to make ticket and volunteer management for community events easier and automated.

=== Usage

When the database is completely blank, the first step is to create the initial account. Lets say you registered as 'kig@fnf.org':

The second step is to make that person a site admin:

[source,bash]
RAILS_ENV=production bin/site-admin add kig@fnf.org

Or, to remove site admin from a given user:

[source,bash]
RAILS_ENV=production bin/site-admin remove kig@fnf.org

=== Developer Setup

We dedicated a separate document to the xref:DEVELOPERS.pdf[developer setup], which helps you get the application running locally.

== API Documentation

Yard-generated documentation is available via running:

[source,bash]
bundle exec rake doc
