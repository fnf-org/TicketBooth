  Friends and Family reminds you to
  %b Leave No Trace

%p
  As such we expect you, as a community, to pack out what you pack in. This
  means that if the packaging and trash came with you,
  %u
    %b it goes home with you.

%p
  If you are hosting a workshop, art project, serving food and drinks, or in
  charge of distributing any merchandise,
  %u
    %b take that excess packaging and recycling home with you
  &mdash; or better yet, don't bring any excess packaging in
  the first place.

%p
  Here are some ideas to reduce your impact at the event and make things
  easier for all of us:

%ul
  %li Transfer store packaged items to a reusable storage container, before you leave home.
  %li Bring aluminum cans instead of glass. Cans can be crushed.
  %li An Altoids tin works great for storing cigarette butts and other MOOP.
  %li A box or crate makes a less messy recycling bin for your camp.
  %li Bring your own trash bags and carry one with you, just in case.
  %li Remind others to pack it in, pack it out.

%p
  We look forward to seeing you at the event!

%p
  So soon!
