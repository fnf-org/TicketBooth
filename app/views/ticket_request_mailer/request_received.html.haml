  We have received your ticket request for #{@event.name}.

-# TODO: This is temporary until tickets stop selling

-#    we'll hold on to your request just in case.

  If your request is approved, we will send you confirmation of the approved
  number of tickets and payment information as soon as we can (in some cases
  this can take a week or more).
