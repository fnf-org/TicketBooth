      If you need to arrive before noon on Friday and are not on the authorized
      list of staff allowed to arrive early, you'll need to purchase a pass for
      each person in your vehicle.

      <<-HELP
      The cost of tickets for children will be dependent on how many you bring.
      Unfortunately, kids count against our limit capacity with our contract
      at the site.  As much as we would like to allow kids in for free, we
      simply cannot afford it. However, we know we start excluding families
      from attending if we charge too much for kids to attend, and so we've
      attempted to create a pricing model that is reasonable and well-balanced.
      If anyone needs further assistance, check the financial assistance
      checkbox below, and give us a brief explanation of what your needs are.
      We'll do our best to work with you to figure something out.
      HELP
    when :cabins
      <<-HELP
      There are a limited number of wood and tent cabins available.
      Both the cabins and the tents are the same price. We encourage everyone to
      bring their own tents and camping gear so that they don't need a cabin.
      Due to limited availability, we will obviously not be able to grant all
      requests.

    when :needs_assistance
      <<-HELP
      We never turn anyone away for financial reasons, and will work with you to
      figure something out. Volunteering for some extra shifts, making payments
      in installments, or requesting discounted tickets are examples of payment
      arrangements we've made in the past.
      HELP
    when :notes

      For example, if you checked the box above, tell us what your needs are. If
      you are bringing kids, please include their ages.
